# Privacy Policy

This is a privacy policy regarding software applications developed by Mobile First LLC (the "developer"). This policy is applies to Shortcuts for Chrome (the "app") that was used to link to this policy. This policy also applies to people installing and using an application (the "user").

### User Accounts

Application does not require users to create login credentials nor to provide any personal information about themselves. If the app persists any data, such as user preferences, that data is stored on device only. Once app is deleted, all application data will be deleted form device also. The developer does not have access nor cannot recover any data about the user.

### 3rd Party Libraries

App may use third party libraries for purposes of implementing specific features needed by the app to function as intended. These include analytics which help to understand user behavior and to provide better experiences for users in the future. Analytics data, if collected, is anonymized and aggregated. It does not identify individual users or personal data.

Note that 3rd party libraries many include their own privacy policies. These policies may be different from this one. However, the developer will very carefully vet each 3rd party library to ensure high integrity of the provider, and does not integrate questionable solutions.

### Acknowledgement

By using the app the user accepts this policy.
