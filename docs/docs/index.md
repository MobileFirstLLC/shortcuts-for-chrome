# Shortcuts for Chrome

*A customizable Chrome browser navigation menu for technical users.**

The menu contains links to technical browser features called _Chrome URLs_.
Normally, Chrome URLs are hard to find, but this menu makes them easily accessible.
With Shortcuts for Chrome you can also pin and sort your favorite Chrome URLs to match your preferences.

This website contains the software documentation for Shortcuts for Chrome.
It is mainly intended for those who want to help in developing the extension.
You can also contribute to the software quality by enhancing the [language translations](translate.md).

and [translation contributors](https://poeditor.com/contributors/project?id_project=440791)
for their efforts in improving this free, open source software! ♡
